# Coffee-Sales-Analysis
Coffee sales analysis with MS Excel

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to understand the purchasing behavior and streamline operations.We will analyze and transform the data into a dynamic, interactive dashboard that franchise owners can use to uncover patterns, identify trends, and spot opportunities to drive business growth.

## Data Source
The dataset, sourced from Maven Analytics’ Data Playground, contains transactional records for Maven Roasters—a fictional coffee shop with three locations in New York City. It includes detailed information such as transaction dates, timestamps, store locations, and individual product-level data for each purchase.

## tools
Excel- pivot table, charts and graphs

## Data cleaning
Cleaning data was essential step for the analysis to help ensure accuracy in the data set.i used the following processes in excel for the data cleaning;
Data standardization, removing nulls, removing duplicates

## Data standardization
Standardizing data ensures consistency, accuracy, and compatibility across datasets. It eliminates discrepancies in formats, units, naming conventions, and data types—creating a reliable foundation for meaningful analysis

## Finding Null Values
We have to remove null and blanks to ensure the data is of good quality.

These Insights reveal that the total revenue generated from sales for last 6 months stands at $698812, having sold a total of 214470 quantities across 149116 transactions. The overall income indicates strong sales performance however, comparing quantity sold and the transactions shows;
Average quantity per transaction = 214470 ÷ 149116 = 1.44 items/transaction
Which means on average most transactions just involve one or two items.

## Recommendations
- Opportunity to Drive Higher Value per Transaction
Although both revenue and transaction numbers are high, the relatively low items-per-transaction ratio suggests the business can unlock more value per customer by encouraging bulk purchases or add-ons.e.g persuade customers to Buy Coffee + Bakery at a discount

- Investigate the revenue for February deaper.Understand why it had the lowest revenue generated. Thereafter, implement actions such as Analyzing foot traffic, product mix, promotions, and external factors e.g weather, holidays.The primary goal should be Identifying and mitigating similar factors of slowdowns in future months.

- Capitalize on Peak Months as they recorded the highest revenue.Identify what worked—popular products, marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, or seasonal demand.The main goal should be Replication of scale winning strategies for future growth.
