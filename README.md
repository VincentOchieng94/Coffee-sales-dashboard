The dataset, sourced from Maven Analytics’ Data Playground, contains transactional records for Maven Roasters—a fictional coffee shop with three locations in New York City. It includes detailed information such as transaction dates, timestamps, store locations, and individual product-level data for each purchase.

## tools
Excel- pivot table, charts and graphs

Cleaning data was essential step for the analysis to help ensure accuracy in the data set.i used the following processes in excel for the data cleaning;
Data standardization, removing nulls, removing duplicates

## data standardization
Standardizing data ensures consistency, accuracy, and compatibility across datasets. It eliminates discrepancies in formats, units, naming conventions, and data types—creating a reliable foundation for meaningful analysis

## removing duplicates
Removing duplicates is essential to ensure data accuracy and integrity. We checked for duplicates but none were found.

### key findings
These Insights reveal that the total revenue generated from sales for last 6 months stands at $698812, having sold a total of 214470 quantities across 149116 transactions. The overall income indicates strong sales performance however, comparing quantity sold and the transactions shows;
Average quantity per transaction = 214470 ÷ 149116 = 1.44 items/transaction
Which means on average most transactions just involve one or two items.
